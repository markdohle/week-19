    <p>Please review the concepts covered this week.</p>

    <h2 id="backend-systems">Backend Systems</h2>
    <p>
      The backend of a website consists of an application, database, and web server. A backend
      developer is someone who maintains and creates code for this system, which sends data to the
      frontend via an API, which is displayed to an end user.
    </p>
    <h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
    <p>
      An API sends and receives information to and from the back end and the front end. You can
      think of the whole system as a restaurant:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The kitchen: The backend of a website, responsible for prepping the data</li>
      <li>
        The waiter: The API of the website, responsible for carrying information from the customer
        to the kitchen and vice versa
      </li>
      <li>
        The menu: The frontend, which displays the available data in an organized, legible format to
        the the customer
      </li>
      <li>The customer: the user of the website</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="content-management-systems-cms-">Content Management Systems (CMS)</h2>
    <p>
      CMS are out-of-the-box backend solutions that make it easy to manage data and connect with the
      front end. Popular examples are Drupal, Wordpress, and Strapi. Without these options, many
      frontend developers would have to build a back end from scratch. Modular solutions like these
      are incredibly popular among front-end developers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="strapi">Strapi</h3>
    <p>
      Strapi is an open-source, Node.js based Content Management System. You can use Strapi as a
      database and API framework that connects to the front end of your choosing. In the videos, Dr.
      Williams uses Strapi to connect the frontend of a shopping cart to the database hosted by
      Strapi.
    </p>

    <h2 id="express">Express</h2>
    <p>
      Express is a server-side framework for NodeJS which facilitates communication between
      client-side software and a database. Express uses routes to send and receive data to/from a
      database to the user facing portion of the app.
    </p>

    <h2 id="server-side-framework">Server Side Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Server-side web frameworks (a.k.a. "web application frameworks") are software frameworks that
      make it easier to write, maintain and scale web applications. They provide tools and libraries
      that simplify common web development tasks, including routing URLs to appropriate handlers,
      interacting with databases, supporting sessions and user authorization, formatting output
      (e.g. HTML, JSON, XML), and improving security against web attacks.
    </p>

    <h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
    <p>
      Postman is a tool to test if your APIs are sending and receiving data through HTTP verbs like
      GET and POST. Postman makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs.
      This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP requests, as well as
      read their responses.
